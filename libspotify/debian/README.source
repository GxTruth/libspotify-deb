libspotify for Debian
---------------------

This package is built using multiple upstream tarballs, as described at
<http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/09/07/how-to-use-multiple-upstream-tarballs-in-debian-source-packages/>.

Since the amd64 and i386 tarballs are equivalent, there is no main upstream
tarball. Thus, the package must be built like this:

    dpkg-buildpackage --source-option=--create-empty-orig
